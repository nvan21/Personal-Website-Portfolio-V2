This research explores how well AI agents, trained by watching expert demonstrations, can adapt to unexpected changes in their environment. I conducted a comprehensive study comparing three key imitation learning algorithms (BC, GAIL, and AIRL) across several simulated robotic tasks with altered physics and goals. The findings reveal the limitations of current methods in generalizing to novel situations and highlight the challenges of transferring a learned understanding of a task's objective.
