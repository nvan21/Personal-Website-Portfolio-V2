# Personal Website Portfolio V2

This is the second version of my personal website and portfolio. I created this project to have complete control over how I present myself and my work online, without being constrained by the templates and limitations of traditional portfolio platforms.

## About The Project

This website serves as a central hub for my projects, skills, and experiences. It's a place where I can showcase my work, share my thoughts, and connect with others in the tech community. By building it from scratch, I have the freedom to design and customize every aspect of it to truly reflect my personal brand and style.
